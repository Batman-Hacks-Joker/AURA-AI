/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Firestore.
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for admin users and their product inventory, while also providing public read access to launched products in the marketplace.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{adminId}/products_inventory/{productId}: Stores products not yet launched, owned by the admin user.
 * - /products_launched/{productId}: Stores products that have been launched into the marketplace; publicly readable.
 * - /agents/{agentId}: Stores agent details; only accessible by authenticated users.
 * - /admins/{adminId}: Stores admin user details; only accessible by the admin user themselves.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Launched products are publicly readable, but only admins can create, update, or delete them, and only if they own the product.
 * - Admin users have full CRUD access to their own product inventory.
 * - Listing of documents in `/users/{adminId}/products_inventory/{productId}` is allowed only for the owning admin.
 * - Agents can only be created by admins, only be read by authenticated users, and can not be updated or deleted once created.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `adminId` field is denormalized in both `/products_launched/{productId}` and `/users/{adminId}/products_inventory/{productId}` to ensure authorization independence. This eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules to verify ownership, improving performance and security.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Products are segregated based on their 'isLaunched' status. Unlaunched products are stored in a user-specific subcollection (`/users/{adminId}/products_inventory/{productId}`), while launched products are stored in a top-level collection (`/products_launched/{productId}`). This enables public read access to launched products without compromising the security of unlaunched products.
